- To install rasa :
(pip install rasa) only few versions of python are supported by rasa like 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.6/python-3.9.6-amd64.exe (3.9 version with which it worked for me)
Note : To run a particular version set environmental varialbes > path > select the one which we want
- Run the following command in your terminal to initialize a new Rasa project.
This command will create a new Rasa project structure with default files and directories.
(rasa init --no-prompt)
- domain.yml
- actions.yml
- rasa train
- rasa run actions
- rasa shell
- created requirements.txt and added all dependencies in this format 'package_name==version_number'
  & use this command to install all the dependencies from the requirements.txt file 
  (python -m pip install -r requirements.txt)
- installed extensions 'gitlens' to check git graphs
- In the path, we should get python path to run out of vitual environment
